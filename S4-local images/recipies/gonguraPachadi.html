        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gongura Pachadi is a tangy, spicy chutney made from sorrel leaves (gongura), which are a staple in Andhra cuisine. Sorrel leaves have a naturally sour taste that, when combined with green chilies and garlic, creates a chutney that’s bursting with flavor. Gongura Pachadi is often enjoyed as an accompaniment to rice, adding a vibrant, zesty note to any meal.
        </p>
        <p>The sorrel leaves are first sautéed to soften them, then ground with green chilies, garlic, and salt. A tempering of mustard seeds, red chilies, and curry leaves is added for an extra burst of flavor. This chutney is unique to Andhra Pradesh and beloved in Guntur for its tangy taste and versatility. Gongura Pachadi is a perfect example of how simple ingredients can be transformed into a flavorful delight with the right spices and preparation.</p>
