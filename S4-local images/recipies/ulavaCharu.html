        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ulava Charu is a hearty, traditional stew beloved in Guntur and across Andhra Pradesh, known for its earthy flavors and deep, rich texture. Made from horse gram (ulavalu), a highly nutritious legume, Ulava Charu is both comforting and nourishing, perfect for cooler days or festive meals. Horse gram is a protein-rich ingredient, and its distinctive taste gives Ulava Charu a unique profile that stands out in the diverse Andhra cuisine.</p>
        <p>To prepare Ulava Charu, horse gram is soaked overnight and then pressure-cooked to extract its flavor. The cooked gram is mashed and simmered with water, allowing it to reach a thick, velvety consistency. The stew is then seasoned with spices like garlic, red chili powder, and curry leaves, creating a warm, spicy kick that pairs beautifully with the natural nuttiness of the gram. Some families add a dash of tamarind for tang, balancing the flavors perfectly. Traditionally served with rice and a dollop of ghee, Ulava Charu is a dish that fills the stomach and the soul.</p>
