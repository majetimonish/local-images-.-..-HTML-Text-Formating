        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Karam Dosa is a spicy variation of the classic dosa, bringing a unique twist to a staple South Indian breakfast. Unlike the usual dosa, Karam Dosa is topped with a layer of red chili chutney while cooking, making it a fiery and flavorful treat. The chutney, made from Guntur chilies, garlic, and a touch of tamarind, infuses the dosa with a robust flavor that is distinctively bold and spicy.</p>
        <p>The dosa batter is spread thinly on a hot griddle, and as it cooks, a thin layer of chili chutney is smeared on top. The chutney’s heat intensifies as it melds with the crispy dosa, creating a delicious contrast between the dosa’s crunch and the chutney’s spiciness. This spicy treat is typically enjoyed with coconut chutney or sambar to balance the heat. Karam Dosa exemplifies Guntur’s passion for spice and flavor, making it a must-try for anyone who loves a bit of a kick in their breakfast.</p>
