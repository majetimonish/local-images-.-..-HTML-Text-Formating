        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gutti Vankaya Kura is a signature dish in Guntur’s culinary scene, revered for its complex flavors and intricate preparation. “Gutti” means “stuffed” in Telugu, and this curry features small brinjals (eggplants) stuffed with a flavorful blend of spices, nuts, and aromatics. The dish is a testament to the culinary artistry of Guntur, as each brinjal is carefully slit and filled, ensuring that every bite bursts with flavor.</p>
        <p>The stuffing mixture includes roasted sesame seeds, peanuts, red chili powder, and coriander seeds, all ground into a smooth paste. This paste is stuffed into each brinjal, which is then sautéed and simmered in a spiced tomato-onion base until tender. The brinjals absorb the sauce, becoming soft and flavorful. Gutti Vankaya Kura pairs exceptionally well with steamed rice or rotis, and it’s a true favorite during festive occasions. This dish encapsulates the rich, spice-forward essence of Guntur’s cuisine, making it a must-try for those who love bold, aromatic curries.</p>
