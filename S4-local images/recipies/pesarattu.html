        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pesarattu is a protein-packed dosa made from green gram (moong dal), a unique twist that sets it apart from traditional dosas. This Andhra classic is popular for its health benefits and distinct flavor, offering a crisp, savory pancake that’s ideal for breakfast or a light meal. It’s typically topped with finely chopped onions, green chilies, and ginger, adding an extra layer of flavor and texture.</p>
        <p>The process starts by soaking green gram and rice, which are then ground into a smooth batter with a hint of ginger for added flavor. The batter is spread on a hot griddle, and as it cooks, onions and green chilies are sprinkled on top. The result is a crispy, flavorful dosa that pairs wonderfully with ginger chutney or tamarind chutney. Pesarattu showcases the versatility of green gram and is loved by both health-conscious individuals and food enthusiasts alike.</p>
