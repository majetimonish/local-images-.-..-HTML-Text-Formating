        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pulihora, also known as tamarind rice, is a staple in Guntur’s festive cuisine, often prepared for celebrations and temple offerings. The dish is known for its tangy, slightly spicy flavor, as rice is infused with tamarind paste, green chilies, and spices. It’s garnished with peanuts and curry leaves, adding both flavor and texture.</p>
        <p>To make Pulihora, cooked rice is mixed with a tamarind paste that’s been simmered with turmeric, green chilies, and a tempering of mustard seeds and curry leaves. Peanuts are added for a nutty crunch, balancing the tang of the tamarind. Pulihora’s unique flavor profile and cultural significance make it a favorite across Andhra Pradesh, and it’s a true representation of Guntur’s traditional cooking style.</p>
