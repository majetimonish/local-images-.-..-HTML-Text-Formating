        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In Guntur, the humble idli is transformed into a spicy delight with the addition of a fiery chili chutney made from Guntur red chilies. This combination is perfect for those who appreciate the soft, mild texture of idlis paired with a bold and spicy chutney. The chutney is typically made by roasting dried Guntur chilies and grinding them with garlic, tamarind, and salt, creating a paste that packs a punch.</p>
        <p>The idlis are prepared from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal, resulting in fluffy, light cakes that balance the heat of the chutney. A tempering of mustard seeds, curry leaves, and a touch of oil brings an extra layer of flavor to the chutney. This dish is a favorite breakfast or snack option for spice lovers and showcases the region’s signature chili-forward flavor profile.</p>
