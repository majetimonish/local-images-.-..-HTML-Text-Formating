        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Punugulu are deep-fried lentil fritters made from idli or dosa batter, known for their crispy exterior and soft, fluffy interior. These bite-sized snacks are popular street food in Guntur, typically served with coconut or ginger chutney for dipping.</p>
        <p>The batter is made by fermenting rice and lentils, which is then seasoned with salt and sometimes green chilies or cumin seeds for extra flavor. Small dollops of the batter are dropped into hot oil, resulting in golden-brown fritters with a satisfying crunch. Punugulu is a delicious snack for any time of the day and perfectly captures the essence of Guntur’s vibrant street food culture.</p>
